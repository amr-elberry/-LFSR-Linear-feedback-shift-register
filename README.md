## *What is LFSR?*

#### - The LFSR is a shift register that has some of its outputs together in exclusive-
OR or exclusive-NOR configurations to form a feedback path.

#### - The initial content of the shift register is referred to as seed. (Note: any value
can be a seed except all 0â€™s to avoid lookup state)

## LFSR Applications
#### *1) Pattern Generators*
#### *2) Encryption*
#### *3) Compression*
#### *4) CRC*
#### *5) Pseudo-Random Bit Sequences (PRBS)*
